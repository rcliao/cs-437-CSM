Never before did I think it was possible to teach the wrong class for an entire quarter without noticing, but as it turns out this unique individual managed to do so. As it turns out the truly proper way to teach C++ is through the extensive use and knowledge of Extensible Application Markup Language. I feel that the wealth of knowledge gained through this professor was more than worth the tuition that I paid for. In fact, I feel that it is so valuable I've decided that next quarter I should just burn $2,110.70 as the knowledge was enough to skip a quarter. Please. Please continue to keep this professor around as it will surely help my fellow students learn as much as I have.' -- coming from one of the students who took CS 332C @ Winter 2013"}
